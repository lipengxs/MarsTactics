**Title: The Red Planet Awaits: Experience Turn-Based Tactical Warfare in Mars Tactics**

War has come to Mars, and the fate of the red planet hangs in the balance. **Mars Tactics**, the upcoming turn-based tactical strategy game developed by Takibi Games and published by Hooded Horse, invites players to experience intense combat on the war-torn surface of Mars when it launches in **May 2026** on PC platforms (Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store).

**Mars Tactics** brilliantly combines XCOM-style turn-based tactical combat with large-scale planetary strategy management, creating a unique gaming experience that challenges players to master both micro and macro strategic gameplay. This innovative approach sets **Mars Tactics** apart from other tactical games, offering depth and complexity rarely seen in the genre.

Players must choose between two asymmetric factions fighting for control of Mars. The **Capital** faction represents large corporations and shareholders, equipped with strong starting resources, sophisticated equipment, and global influence. However, they must constantly meet Earth's demands, creating strategic constraints that balance their material advantages. In contrast, the **Labor** faction consists of resource-poor but determined revolutionary forces, relying on flexible tactics, local manufacturing, and high morale to overcome their disadvantages.

The battlefield environment in **Mars Tactics** is completely destructible, adding unprecedented tactical depth to every engagement. Can't find good cover? Use a grenade to "dig" a beautiful trench for your troops. Trapped with a wall blocking your retreat? Destroy it to create a new attack route. Enemy forces hiding in buildings? Call in an airstrike to level entire structures from the map. **Mars Tactics** uses destruction mechanics as a creative tactical choice, allowing players to reshape the battlefield to their advantage.

The fire and movement system in **Mars Tactics** introduces sophisticated suppression mechanics. Even missed shots create suppression effects that impact enemy actions in the next turn. Successful suppression can earn your team additional action points for later use, creating strategic decisions about whether to attack bravely and immediately seek cover, or let allies use the suppression advantage for additional actions.

Squad members in **Mars Tactics** each have their own abilities, items, and weapons, and they continuously improve their combat skills through battlefield experience. During combat, players can share equipment as needed—passing magazines to teammates who need them, or handing grenades to soldiers in better positions to pull the pin and throw at enemies. This real-time equipment sharing adds tactical depth and allows for creative combat strategies.

Beyond individual tactical battles, **Mars Tactics** features a comprehensive strategic layer where players manage planetary warfare. Obtain jets for rapid troop movement and air support, build bases to develop new technologies and train recruits, establish outposts and supply lines to ensure forces can operate across Mars. Control key resource points and coordinate large-scale operations—armies without supplies will have miserable outcomes on the battlefield.

Character progression in **Mars Tactics** is dynamic and shaped by actions rather than fixed classes. All characters are shaped through actions and experience. One-shot multiple enemies? Your soldier might gain the "Dead Eye" trait. Save a wounded teammate and discover medical talent? Every new recruit from either faction will become a hardened veteran in war, entering combat in transport ships and armored vehicles. Players can also spend money to hire deadly mercenaries from Earth who want to make quick money, providing immediate combat effectiveness.

After surviving the battlefield meat grinder, your troops will become scarred veterans. Players can also choose to take the war further, using cybernetic technology to make your soldiers superhuman. Whether fighting to maintain Corporate hegemony or choosing to liberate the many workers, **Mars Tactics** combines turn-based combat with a real strategic layer—players aren't just leading a few units in small skirmishes, but fighting for the future of an entire planet.

Critics are already praising **Mars Tactics**. PC Gamer notes: "For common tactical games, the new campaign management and base building in this game are very interesting changes, so I'm looking forward to seeing how this game performs in the market." Sports Illustrated adds: "This game combines the intense turn-based combat of XCOM with more strategic elements, giving players great freedom. Environmental destruction means you can shape the battlefield to your needs, while the diverse character specialization system rewards soldiers with special attributes based on their battlefield behavior."

**Mars Tactics** is currently available for wishlist on Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store. Visit **marstactics.com** to learn more about the game, view screenshots, watch gameplay videos, and read comprehensive guides. Join the growing community of tactical strategy enthusiasts preparing for war on Mars. The red planet awaits—will you fight for Capital or Labor?

**标题：红色星球在召唤：在《火星战略》中体验回合制战术战争**

战火已经蔓延到火星，这颗红色星球的命运悬而未决。由 Takibi Games 开发、知名独立游戏发行商 Hooded Horse（曾发行《庄园领主》等）出版的 **《火星战略》（Mars Tactics）**，邀请玩家在 **2026年5月** 游戏于 PC 平台（Steam、GOG 和 Epic Games Store）发布时，在这颗战火纷飞的火星表面体验激烈的战斗。

**《火星战略》** 巧妙地将《幽浮》式的回合制战术战斗与大规模的行星战略管理相结合，创造出独特的游戏体验，挑战玩家同时掌握微观和宏观战略玩法。这种创新的方法使 **《火星战略》** 在同类游戏中脱颖而出，提供了该类型中罕见的深度和复杂性。

玩家必须在争夺火星控制权的两个不对称阵营中选择一个。**资本方**代表大企业和股东，拥有强大的起始资源、精良的装备和全球影响力。然而，他们必须不断满足地球方面的需求，这造成了战略约束，平衡了他们的物质优势。相比之下，**劳动方**由资源匮乏但意志坚定的革命军组成，依靠灵活的战术、当地制造和高昂的士气来克服劣势。

**《火星战略》** 中的战场环境完全可以被摧毁，为每次交战增添了前所未有的战术深度。找不到好的掩体？用手榴弹为你的部队"挖"一条漂亮的战壕。被墙壁阻挡无法撤退？摧毁它来创造新的进攻路线。敌军躲在建筑物里？呼叫空袭将整个建筑从地图上夷平。**《火星战略》** 将摧毁机制作为一种富有创意的战术选择，允许玩家重塑战场以获取优势。

**《火星战略》** 中的开火与移动系统引入了复杂的压制机制。即使子弹未命中，也会产生压制效果，影响敌人下一回合的行动。成功的压制可以为你的队伍赢得额外的行动点供后续使用，这创造了战略决策：是勇敢地攻击后立即寻找掩护，还是让盟友利用压制优势进行额外行动。

**《火星战略》** 中的小队成员每个人都有各自的能力、物品和武器，他们通过战场经验不断提高战斗技能。在战斗中，玩家可以根据需要分享装备——将弹匣递给需要的队友，或将手榴弹交给位置更好的士兵来拔除插销并扔向敌人。这种实时装备分享增加了战术深度，允许创造性的战斗策略。

除了个别的战术战斗，**《火星战略》** 还包含一个全面的战略层，玩家需要管理行星战争。获得喷射机以确保部队快速移动和空中支援，建造基地以开发新技术和训练新兵，建立前哨站和补给线，确保部队能在整个火星上行动。控制关键资源点并协调大规模行动——补给不足的军队在战场上会有凄惨的下场。

**《火星战略》** 中的角色成长是动态的，由行动塑造而非固定职业。所有角色都通过行动和经验来形塑。一发就击杀多名敌人？你的士兵可能会获得"百步穿杨"的特质。救下一名受伤的队员并发现医学天份？无论是哪个阵营的新兵，他们都会在战争中成为强悍老兵，乘坐运输船与装甲车进入战斗。玩家也可以花钱雇佣想赚快钱的致命佣兵，提供即时的战斗效果。

在战场绞肉机中幸存后，你的部队将成为伤痕累累的退伍军人。玩家也可以选择让战争更进一步，藉由神经机械科技让你的士兵成为超人类的存在。无论是为了让企业维持霸权而战，还是选择解放众多劳工，**《火星战略》** 将回合制战斗与真实战略层面结合—玩家不仅仅只是带着几支部队在小打小闹，而是为整个星球的未来战斗。

评论家们已经开始称赞 **《火星战略》**。PC Gamer 指出："对于常见的战术类游戏来说，本作中新增的战役管理和基地建设是非常有趣的变化，所以我很期待看到这款游戏在市场上的表现。"Sports Illustrated 补充道："这款游戏结合了《幽浮》中激烈的回合制战斗和更具策略性的元素，为玩家提供了很大的自由度。环境破坏意味着你可以根据自己的需要塑造战场，而多样化的角色特长系统则可以根据战士在战场上的行为奖励其特殊属性。"

**《火星战略》** 目前已在 Steam、GOG 和 Epic Games Store 开启预约。访问 **marstactics.com** 了解更多游戏信息，查看截图，观看游戏视频，并阅读全面的攻略。加入不断壮大的战术策略爱好者社区，准备在火星上作战。红色星球在召唤—你会为资本方还是劳动方而战？
