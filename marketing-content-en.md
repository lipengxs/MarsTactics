War has come to Mars, and the fate of the red planet hangs in the balance. **Mars Tactics**, the upcoming turn-based tactical strategy game developed by Takibi Games and published by Hooded Horse, invites players to experience intense combat on the war-torn surface of Mars when it launches in **May 2026** on PC platforms (Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store).

## Unique Gaming Experience

**Mars Tactics** brilliantly combines XCOM-style turn-based tactical combat with large-scale planetary strategy management, creating a unique gaming experience that challenges players to master both micro and macro strategic gameplay. This innovative approach sets **Mars Tactics** apart from other tactical games, offering depth and complexity rarely seen in the genre.

## Two Asymmetric Factions

Players must choose between two asymmetric factions fighting for control of Mars. The **Capital** faction represents large corporations and shareholders, equipped with strong starting resources, sophisticated equipment, and global influence. However, they must constantly meet Earth's demands, creating strategic constraints that balance their material advantages. In contrast, the **Labor** faction consists of resource-poor but determined revolutionary forces, relying on flexible tactics, local manufacturing, and high morale to overcome their disadvantages.

## Completely Destructible Battlefield

The battlefield environment in **Mars Tactics** is completely destructible, adding unprecedented tactical depth to every engagement. Can't find good cover? Use a grenade to "dig" a beautiful trench for your troops. Trapped with a wall blocking your retreat? Destroy it to create a new attack route. Enemy forces hiding in buildings? Call in an airstrike to level entire structures from the map. **Mars Tactics** uses destruction mechanics as a creative tactical choice, allowing players to reshape the battlefield to their advantage.

## Sophisticated Suppression System

The fire and movement system in **Mars Tactics** introduces sophisticated suppression mechanics. Even missed shots create suppression effects that impact enemy actions in the next turn. Successful suppression can earn your team additional action points for later use, creating strategic decisions about whether to attack bravely and immediately seek cover, or let allies use the suppression advantage for additional actions.

## Real-Time Equipment Sharing

Squad members in **Mars Tactics** each have their own abilities, items, and weapons, and they continuously improve their combat skills through battlefield experience. During combat, players can share equipment as needed—passing magazines to teammates who need them, or handing grenades to soldiers in better positions to pull the pin and throw at enemies. This real-time equipment sharing adds tactical depth and allows for creative combat strategies.

## Comprehensive Strategic Layer

Beyond individual tactical battles, **Mars Tactics** features a comprehensive strategic layer where players manage planetary warfare. Obtain jets for rapid troop movement and air support, build bases to develop new technologies and train recruits, establish outposts and supply lines to ensure forces can operate across Mars. Control key resource points and coordinate large-scale operations—armies without supplies will have miserable outcomes on the battlefield.

## Dynamic Character Progression

Character progression in **Mars Tactics** is dynamic and shaped by actions rather than fixed classes. All characters are shaped through actions and experience. One-shot multiple enemies? Your soldier might gain the "Dead Eye" trait. Save a wounded teammate and discover medical talent? Every new recruit from either faction will become a hardened veteran in war, entering combat in transport ships and armored vehicles. Players can also spend money to hire deadly mercenaries from Earth who want to make quick money, providing immediate combat effectiveness.

## Cybernetic Upgrades

After surviving the battlefield meat grinder, your troops will become scarred veterans. Players can also choose to take the war further, using cybernetic technology to make your soldiers superhuman. Whether fighting to maintain Corporate hegemony or choosing to liberate the many workers, **Mars Tactics** combines turn-based combat with a real strategic layer—players aren't just leading a few units in small skirmishes, but fighting for the future of an entire planet.

## Critical Acclaim

Critics are already praising **Mars Tactics**. PC Gamer notes: "For common tactical games, the new campaign management and base building in this game are very interesting changes, so I'm looking forward to seeing how this game performs in the market." Sports Illustrated adds: "This game combines the intense turn-based combat of XCOM with more strategic elements, giving players great freedom. Environmental destruction means you can shape the battlefield to your needs, while the diverse character specialization system rewards soldiers with special attributes based on their battlefield behavior."
